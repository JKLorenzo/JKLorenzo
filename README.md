## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

<img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=JKLorenzo" alt="kyranet" />

My name is Juruel Keanu Lorenzo, I am from Bacolod City (Philippines), and I am
a 3rd Year Computer Engineering student at the University of St. La Salle.

I enjoy testing stuff out and usually develops softwares out of curiosity. 
I'm currently working on a [Discord Bot] and it is my first time utilizing 
node.js and other javascript related entities. 

The thing that sparked my interest on software programming was when I really wanted 
to create an automation for a game I used to play during my high school (sophomore) 
days. Learned some programming languages along the way like Visual Basic(.NET), C#(.NET), 
and AutoIT to try to achieve what I've had in mind. Few years have passed and now I'm close 
to graduating as a Computer Engineer! âœ¨

I'm mostly active on [Discord], so if you ever want to get in contact with me then 
you can best do so by joining [this Discord server] (your friends can join here too). 
Cheers!
