## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

<img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=JKLorenzo" alt="JKLorenzo Profile Views" />

My name is Juruel Keanu Lorenzo, I am from Bacolod City (Philippines), and I am
a 4th Year Computer Engineering student at the University of St. La Salle.

I enjoy testing stuff out and usually develop software out of curiosity. 
I'm currently working on a [Discord Bot] written using TypeScript to learn more about TS.
I previously made a similar bot utilizing JavaScript, which can be found [here].

The thing that sparked my interest in software programming was when I really wanted to create 
an automation for a game I used to play during my high school days. Learned some programming 
languages along the way, like Visual Basic and C#, to try to achieve what I've had in mind. 
Few years have passed, now I'm close to graduating as a Computer Engineer! âœ¨
